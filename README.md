# SCP:CB - SkellyMod
(creative name i know)

This is a mod for SCP CB that adds more SCPs. I try not to add SCPs that are already in other mods as it would make this mod that different.

A lot of the stuff I added isn't exactly that useful, so it's more of a "fan-service" mod.

I'll finish typing this up later

also the source code is in the mod files but I left the .bb files here just incase
